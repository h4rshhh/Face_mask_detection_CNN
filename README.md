![stuuupegg-mask](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01e7445b-a8ff-4dce-a6be-370f51e6f339)

A deep learning system for Real time face-mask detection 
## ðŸŽ¯ About Project

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network, to differentiate between images of people with and without masks. The CNN manages to get an accuracy of 96.2% on the training set and 94.3% on the test set. 
Then the stored weights of this CNN are used to classify as mask or no mask, in real time, using _OpenCV_. With the webcam capturing the video, the frames are preprocessed and and fed to the model to accomplish this task. The model works efficiently with no apparent lag time between wearing/removing mask and display of prediction.

The model is capable of predicting multiple faces with or without masks at the same time
